I never worked under him in the past, nor working in the present, and will not work in future,\" Shahabuddin said just before his cavalcade comprising at least 400 SUVs left for his bastion of Siwan. The long spell behind bars had interrupted a long period of influence and prominence when his writ ran over Siwan and adjoining districts and he became a factor in Lalu Prasad's political scheme.\n\nHis imprisonment and subsequent conviction followed the defeat of RJD in 2005 elections and were seen as symbolising Nitish's attempt to the lawlessness which defined Lalu-Rabri raj. His release follows the alliance between Lalu and Nitish with opponents alleging that it's part of the deal between the two Mandal leaders.\n\nShahabuddin's statement, however, showed he owes no gratitude to Nitish for his walk into freedom as he proclaimed Lalu to be his sole leader. However, for the thousands who had gathered outside Bhagalpur Central Jail to fete the man who was once seen as the `Subedar of Siwan', it was `Shahabu' or `Sahib' who seemed to matter.\n\nThey hailed him as `Bhagwan', dismissing the litany of charges of heinous crimes against him as conspiracy of political opponents and broke into spontaneous jigs.\n\nNamed in at least 39 cases and acquitted in 20 of them, Shahabuddin once spelt terror in Bihar. Among many charges, he was accused of involvement in the murder of the then JNUSU president Chandras hekhar in March 1997 for the latter's audacity to campaign for CPI(ML)'s candidate against him in Siwan. He was also awarded life term in a twin murder case which pertained to burning two brothers alive by pouring acid on them.\n\nAfter his release, Shahabuddin declared with elan that he won't be changing his image now that \"I am a free man\". He asked, \"Why should I change my image?

Geetanjali who now studies in London said, \"My father always treated me as a burden and for every single rupee he spent on me, he has abused me and mistreated me physically. My father molested me when I was 13 years old. I am so ashamed to say that he used to come in to my room and touch me at wrong places. He used to put his hand under my skirt and inside my shirt. My father used to kiss me lips and press my chest against his own many times.\" She says she had gone through this obscene treatment for two years not knowing what to do and who to tell except to cry at night.\n\n\"My human dignity, self-respect, mind and soul has been scarred for life because to this man,\" she alleged. She finally gathered courage and spoke to her mother of the sexual abuse of her father and her mother confronted Meena threatening to report to the police, says his daughter. \nGeetanjali alleges that Meena and his family members abused her mother for not giving birth to a son and not giving divorce to him for a second marriage.\n\nIt was also alleged that due to the clout he enjoyed in the police and civil administration, the police never bothered to register case and investigate the matter independently. The police had always tried for a compromise and argued in favour of her father, she alleged.

Pricing is determined by several factors. We are not doing this for economic gains but for our friendly relations with India and can look at reducing the price to the extent possible,\" added the official.\n\nJapan is now hoping that there will be some progress in negotiations by the time PM Narendra Modi visits Tokyo later this year for the annual summit meet. Known for its short takeoff capability, the aircraft was meant to be deployed in the Andaman Nicobar Islands. \n\nAfter Japan overturned its self-imposed 1967 ban on export of arms in 2014, India was expected to become the first country to purchase defence equipment from Japan with an agreement for US-2 aircraft. India and Japan had last year, after the summit meeting between Modi and his counterpart Shinzo Abe, signed an agreement for transfer of defence equipment and technology. \n\nThe 2 leaders had then said that they wanted to to deepen the bilateral defence relationship through two-way collaboration and technology cooperation, co-development and co-production. They had also expressed an intention to explore ``potential future projects on defence equipment and technology cooperation such as US-2 amphibian aircraft''.\n\nThe negotiations for the aircraft though were left in limbo with serious differences over pricing and India's demand that the aircraft come with state-of-the -art surveillance technology. Japanese officials, however, said there was no sensitive technology involved with the US-2 and wanted to treat it as a regular search and rescue seaplane only. India also wants co-production here as the government believes it can provide an impetus to the Make in India initiative. According to Japanese defence ministry officials, manufacturing in India would be feasible only if the agreement comprised sale of a certain number of aircraft. ``If the number is too few, it would not be cost effective for India,'' said the official.\n\nMaritime security is one of the key areas in Japan's cooperation with India. Japan, which is now participating regularly in India's Malabar exercise with the US, has encouraged India to speak up on issues related to South China Sea. Japan is currently having to contend with an increasing assertive China in East China Sea where Chinese vessels continue to enter Japanese territorial waters in large numbers. While the Chinese coast guard have repeatedly ventured into Japan's contiguous zone and territorial seas near Senkaku (Chinese call it Diaoyu) islands, a Chinese navy vessel entered the contiguous zone for the first time in June this year. Japanese authorities see this as fresh escalation by China.\n", "ByLine": "Sachin Parashar", "images": [{"imagetoken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzkwYUhWdFlpNWpiWE0vY0dodmRHOXBaRDAxTkRJM01qYzVNZz09NTdkNGY0NmRhNjBhOA==", "id": "54272792"}], "HeadLine": "Japan may cut price to ink aircraft deal with India", "DateLine": "Sep 11, 2016, 05.57AM IST", "Agency": "TNN", "CommentsToken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzkxYzNKamIyMXRaVzUwWm1WbFpITnVaWGN2TlRReU56STNPVEl1WTIxelAyWmxaV1IwZVhCbFBYTnFjMjl1NTdkNGY0NmRhNjAwMA==", "Caption": "Japan is negotiating the sale of Shinmaywa US-2 search and rescue aircraft with New Delhi not for any economic gain, but because it considers India a friendly country, Tokyo has said amid reports that the deal had collapsed over pricing and technology transfer issues.", "NewsItemId": "54272792", "Keywords": "Tokyo, new delhi japan, Narendra Modi, Modi, Japan", "WebURL": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Japan-may-cut-price-to-ink-aircraft-deal-with-India/articleshow/54272792.cms", "RelatedNewsToken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzl1WlhkemNtVnNZWFJsWkdabFpXUnpMelUwTWpjeU56a3lMbU50Y3o5bVpXVmtkSGx3WlQxemFuTnZiZz09NTdkNGY0NmRhNjA2Yg==", "Image": {"Photo": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=54272796", "Thumb": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb.cms?photoid=54272796", "PhotoCaption": "Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

This skewed gender ratio on the social networking site falls in line with most other trends of internet usage in the country . Experts say this only illustrates the barriers women in India face in accessing technology and information.\n\nJust last year, Facebook touched 125 million users in India, making it the social networking giant's second largest market globally.Analysing the Menlo Parkbased company's own reported data for the third quarter of 2016, Singaporebased analytics firm We Are Social found that in India, men made up an overwhelming 76% of the user base. Its report, titled Digital in APAC 2016, says that the overall social media usage in the country has grown by 23% since March 2015.\n\nA look at some of the older data released by differ ent agencies reveals that the online gender gap has been consistent. In March 2016, a report from the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) found that females made up only 35% of the mobile internet user base in India. In a report released June 2016, the GSM Association a global association of mobile operators found Indian males to be 62% more likely to be internet users than females.\n\n\"Women got left behind in the education revolution, the industrial revolution, and now we see that happening in the digital revolution,\" says Centre for Social Research director Ranjana Kumari. Preferential treatment for sons and male children shows up here as well, she points out. \"If a family has to choose between giving a phone to a male and a female child, the boy gets it.Parents discourage girls from using the Internet.This way, one of the most creative and democratic spaces is being taken away from them,\" she says.\n\nIn February this year, Suraj village in Gujarat's Mehsana district and Basauli village UP's in Gonda block banned mobile phones for women. In 2014, a Muzaffarnagar khap panchayat applied the same rules for the 46 villages under it. Their reason? It leads to moral corruption and an increase in crimes against women.Speaking to TOI in June, Digital Empowerment Foundation head Osama Manzar had explained this behaviour. \"Anything that gives women private access to information is regarded as dangerous,\" he had said.\n\nAll may not be lost, though. In March 2016, a report from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Retailers Association of India (RAI) forecast that females would make up 40% of the urban internet users in India by 2020.\n", "ByLine": "Kim Arora", "images": [{"imagetoken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzkwYUhWdFlpNWpiWE0vY0dodmRHOXBaRDAxTkRJM01qY3hPQT09NTdkNGY0NmRhNjE4OQ==", "id": "54272718"}], "HeadLine": "In India, only 24% of Facebook users are women'", "DateLine": "Sep 11, 2016, 05.40AM IST", "Agency": "TNN", "CommentsToken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzkxYzNKamIyMXRaVzUwWm1WbFpITnVaWGN2TlRReU56STNNVGd1WTIxelAyWmxaV1IwZVhCbFBYTnFjMjl1NTdkNGY0NmRhNjBlMQ==", "Caption": "Only 24% of Facebook users in India are female.

The study pointed out that the choice of the subject rests with the parents and does not depend on academic or feasibility issues of schools.\n\nIn Karnataka, it was found five periods were dedicated to English in a week at all stages of schooling -primary, upper primary and secondary -while Sikkim dedicates 10 hours a week for teaching the language at the secondary level.\n\nAlong with Punjab, Manipur, Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal, Karnataka is yet to implement the NCF. Besides Sikkim, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh have allo cated eight periods weekly for English-language teaching at the primary level. However, Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya do not give much importance to English.\n\nIn terms of giving importance to mother tongue, West Bengal, which conducts an examination for Bengali language for 200 marks for upper primary students, tops the list. At the secondary level in Karnataka, Kannada, offered as the first language along with Sanskrit and English, accounts for 125 marks. However, most states cap marks for the mother tongue to 100.\n\nKarnataka schools dedicate six periods a week for Kannada, while Maharashtra has allocated 13 hours weekly for Marathi - the most in the country . Andhra Pradesh conducts 12 periods a week for Telugu at the primary level.\n\nThe report found that 15 states across the country follow NCERT prescribed curriculum and textbooks. On the other hand, 14 states have managed to integrate the NCERT prescribed syllabus within their own.

The study was conducted to assess the status of the curriculum at schools introduced in 2000.\n\nThe report analysed the structure of the curriculum, working days, school hours, class hours in a week and pedagogical techniques among other aspects of school education in the country .\n\nMore recesses lead to more study\n\nMore recesses lead to greater willingness to study among students, a 10-year National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) survey has found. But only one recess period is provided in schools during the day in 23 states and Union territories. These schools recorded a total working time of six hours and a break ranging from 30-40 minutes daily. In Sikkim, where working hours are seven daily, students are given two breaks - one of 15 minutes and another of 35 minutes. \n\nThe survey said that school hours tend to increase because of longer recesses, but also help break monotony . At the secondary school level, three recesses are given in schools in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala, while Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra provide just two breaks daily.Interestingly, Puducherry has a system of just one 15-minute break throughout six-hour school day.\n\n", "ByLine": "Deepika Burli", "images": [{"imagetoken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzkwYUhWdFlpNWpiWE0vY0dodmRHOXBaRDAxTkRJM01qWTNNZz09NTdkNGY0NmRhNjI2OA==", "id": "54272672"}], "HeadLine": "NCERT survey reveals state of English in Indian schools", "DateLine": "Sep 11, 2016, 05.27AM IST", "Agency": "TNN", "CommentsToken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzkxYzNKamIyMXRaVzUwWm1WbFpITnVaWGN2TlRReU56STJOekl1WTIxelAyWmxaV1IwZVhCbFBYTnFjMjl1NTdkNGY0NmRhNjFjMQ==", "Caption": "Jammu & Kashmir tops the charts for most English classes at the upper primary level with nine periods a week, a decade-long National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) study has revealed.", "NewsItemId": "54272672", "Keywords": "NCERT", "WebURL": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/NCERT-survey-reveals-state-of-English-in-Indian-schools/articleshow/54272672.cms", "RelatedNewsToken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzl1WlhkemNtVnNZWFJsWkdabFpXUnpMelUwTWpjeU5qY3lMbU50Y3o5bVpXVmtkSGx3WlQxemFuTnZiZz09NTdkNGY0NmRhNjIyYw==", "Image": {"Photo": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo.cms?photoid=", "Thumb": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb.cms?photoid=", "PhotoCaption": ""}, "CommentsCountToken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzkxYzJWeVkyOXRiV1Z1ZEdOdmRXNTBMelUwTWpjeU5qY3lMbU50Y3c9PTU3ZDRmNDZkYTYxZjc="}, {"Story": "AHMEDABAD: Gujarat's Dalits, led by the Una Dalit Atyachar Ladat Samiti (UDALS), will send postcards to Bollywood star Ambitabh Bachchan with the message `Badbu Gujarat Ki'.\n\nBachchan has been promoting Gujarat tourism with the famous taglines, `Khushbu Gujarat ki' and `Kuchh din toh Gujariye Gujarat mein'.\n\nJignesh Mevani, convener of UDALS, said they will organise a public meeting on September 13 in the city where thousands of Dalit families will write postcards to Bachchan.\n\n\"Following PM Narendra Modi's request, he had done `Khushbu Gujarat Ki' commercials.

The T42 high jump event is for single above-the-knee amputees. There was another reason to cheer. India came up with a second finish as Greater Noida boy Varun Bhati, who got polio when he was a child, took bronze in the same event with a jump of 1.86m.\n\nThis is India's third gold medal in Paralympics, the first two were won by Murlikant Patekar (swimming, 1972) and Devendra Jhajharia (javelin throw, 2004).\n\nMariyappan, who is now ranked no. 1 in T42 category, was emotional after his win. \"It felt surreal when I stood on the podium. All the sacrifices made by my mother have paid off. My first agenda now is to construct a big house for our family,\" he said.\n\nAbandoned by his father 10 years ago, Mariyappan's mother, Saroja, single-handedly fended for her four children. With cash rewards now pouring in - Tamil Nadu government has announced a Rs 2-cr reward -- the family from Periyavadagampatti village in Salem district of Tamil Nadu can put their hard days behind them.\n\nMariyappan was injured in a bus accident when he was just five but that did not stop him from taking part in sports events alongside regular competitors, and winning.\n\nAt the Government Higher Secondary School in Periyavadagampatti, physical director R Rajendiran saw the spark in Mariyappan. \"During those days, he would jump more than a normal person. I asked him to take part in the regular category and he started winning competitions year after year,\" says the 48-year-old. Till 2011, Mariyappan took part only in the regular category at the district level. \"It was a meet in Hosur that changed his life. The Krishnagiri collector said he had great potential to win at the Paralympics. Then we decided to shift focus,\" said Rajendiran.\n\nSince 2015, he has been training under national coach R Sathyanarayanan in Bangalore. \"Rajendiran sir is a great motivator. It was his decision that saw me make a move to Bangalore in 2015,\" said Mariyappan, now a BBA graduate.\n\nThe gold medal might, in fact, have come four years too late, said M S Nagarajan, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Paralympics Association, thanks to a delayed call-up for the London Games. \"He received the call at the last minute because of some miscommunication in the federation. By the time we could arrange the papers, it was too late for him. I expected gold from him and he has made us proud,\" said Nagarajan.\n\nMariyappan isn't resting, though.

With over 1.6 crore retail shops in the country, about one for every 15 families, this sector of work outguns every other. \n\nManufacturing, considered the backbone of prosperity for any economy, is second to retail with over 1 crore units. But manufacturing employs over 3 crore people beating retail trade, which has about 2.7 crore. \n\nTransport companies, warehousing, hotels and eateries, and healthcare-related enterprises are other major occupations, while educational enterprises have emerged as major employers with over 2 million such businesses employing nearly 1.1 million people. \n\nThese facts emerge from the 6th Economic Census conducted by the government in 2013, detailed results of which were released earlier this year. The economic census counts all kinds of enterprises across the country except cultivation of crops and their care and protection. In this census, some 5.8 crore enterprises were counted, employing over 13 crore persons. The previous one was done in 2005. \n\nThe sector that has really boomed is construction, with employment in it growing at a breathtaking 27 percent per year. This is 2013 data so it will not reflect subsequent travails of the sector.\n\nTrade is in itself arguably the biggest employer if one adds up wholesale trade and sale and repair of motor vehicles which the Census counted separately. Putting all three together one gets about 1.8 cr enterprises employing 3.2 cr people, nearly 35 percent of all non-agricultural and non-extractive industries.\n\nThis picture of a bustling economic hive with vast numbers involved in diverse enterprise building needs to be tempered with some economic cold water. Nearly 96 percent of all enterprises employ one to five workers, with just 1.4 percent employing more than 10 workers. Compared to 2005, the share of enterprises in the 1-5 category has marginally increased. \n\nThis indicates the atomized and dispersed nature of entrepreneurial activity, which, especially in the case of manufacturing, speaks of a rather low economic level. Of the three cr manufacturing enterprises, about a third, that is one cr, are working without any hired worker.\n\nEconomists have suggested earlier that retail trade is in fact a last resort for families seeking to boost incomes by selling a few items in villages or weekly haats. This transient nature of retail trade seems to be confirmed by the fact that 25 percent of these establishments are run from within homes and 17 percent are run without any fixed structure.\n\n", "ByLine": "Subodh Varma", "images": [{"imagetoken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzkwYUhWdFlpNWpiWE0vY0dodmRHOXBaRDAxTkRJM01UYzNNQT09NTdkNGY0NmRhNjk3Mg==", "id": "54271770"}], "HeadLine": "The retail-friendly Indian: A shop for every 15 families", "DateLine": "Sep 11, 2016, 01.11AM IST", "Agency": "TNN", "CommentsToken": "YUhSMGNEb3ZMM1JwYldWemIyWnBibVJwWVM1cGJtUnBZWFJwYldWekxtTnZiUzkxYzNKamIyMXRaVzUwWm1WbFpITnVaWGN2TlRReU56RTNOekF1WTIxelAyWmxaV1IwZVhCbFBYTnFjMjl1NTdkNGY0NmRhNjhiZA==", "Caption": "Indians continue to show their entrepreneurial spirit - by opening more and more shops.
